# ESP32-ESP-NOW-Walkie-Talkie
A DIY half-duplex walkie-talkie built using two ESP32 boards, ESP-NOW for wireless communication, and I2S audio (digital microphone + amplifier). This project was developed as a learning prototype to explore real-time audio streaming, wireless protocols, and embedded system integration.
